# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic and problem-solving patterns.  
The goal of this repository is to build strong foundations in data structures and algorithms through consistent, thoughtful practice.

This is a learning-focused repository that emphasizes **clarity of thought, pattern recognition, and clean implementation**.

---

## Purpose

- Improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking
- Identify common patterns across problems
- Write readable and well-structured solutions
- Track long-term learning progress

---

## Repository Structure

Problems are grouped by topic to make patterns easier to recognize.

arrays/
strings/
linked_list/
stack_queue/
trees/
graphs/
dynamic_programming/
math/
patterns.md

Each problem is stored in its respective topic folder.

---

## Problem Format

Each problem file typically contains:

- Problem name and link
- Brief explanation of the approach
- Key observations and edge cases
- Time and space complexity
- Final solution code

The focus is on **why the solution works**, not just the final answer.

---

## Problem-Solving Approach

For each problem, I generally follow this process:

1. Understand the problem constraints and edge cases
2. Think through a brute-force approach
3. Identify an optimal pattern or data structure
4. Optimize the solution step by step
5. Write clean and readable code
6. Reflect on what the problem teaches

## Common Patterns Practiced

- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Boundary shrinking (matrix traversal)
- Fast and slow pointers
- Hashing and frequency counting
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Dynamic programming (top-down and bottom-up)

Additional notes on patterns are documented in `patterns.md`.

---

## Progress Philosophy

- Problems range from Easy to Hard
- Solutions may be revisited and improved
- Commit history reflects meaningful learning milestones

Quality and understanding are prioritized over quantity.

---

## Language Used

- Python (primary)

---

## Disclaimer

These solutions are written for educational purposes.  
Readers are encouraged to attempt problems independently before referring to the solutions.

## Final Note

This repository represents my continuous journey in learning data structures and algorithms through LeetCode.  
Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
